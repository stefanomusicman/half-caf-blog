  title: "We are Half Caf Blog, <br> Team of passionate coffee conoisseurs."
  description: "Welcome to Half Caf Blog, a place for all things coffee within the greater Montreal Area. Here you will find a variety of content including coffee shop reviews, coffee reviews and coffee machine reviews! We are a small team of people who are passionate about coffee and would like nothing more than to provide Montrealers with non-biased information for anything related to coffee.
  
  
  At Half Caf Blog, when we review anything, we don't simply focus on the overall trendiness of a product/coffee shop but we also put a lot of emphasis on the actual coffee! For instance, when we review a coffee shop, we always order two drinks, a black espresso in order to get a taste for the raw coffee being served and then a milk drink (preferably a cortado style drink) to get a taste of whether or not the milk is being heated skillfully."
